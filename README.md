terminedia paint
=================



Interactive app to create ASCII-art and Unicode art in
an interactive way directly from the terminal

This is very early work, not released and changing each day.
yet you can run the development version and try it -
just by having an  Python > 3.6 installed and typing:

`pip install --user git+https://github.com/jsbueno/terminedia-paint.git && terminedia-paint`

(`--user` can be omitted if you have an active virtual environment)



Currently it works on Linux, Mac and other Posix software -
there might be some limited functionality under windows
(no mouse suport yet though)

This is in very ealy stage - the main idea
is to enable people to create text-art in by
using terminedia's capabilities, without having
to resort to Python programming.

This is also set as a demonstration project
for terminedia: https://github.com/jsbueno/terminedia

How to run: pip install the main branch directly with
`pip install git+https://github.com/jsbueno/terminedia-paint.git
and run "terminedia-paint" on the terminal.


It is currently using the main branch of terminedia so it
might break if upadated, via pip, without updating terminedia as well.
(it is being used as lab to activelly develop the widget system in terminedia,
 so changes should occur often)
