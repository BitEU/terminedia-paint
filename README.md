terminedia paint
=================

Interactive app to create ASCII-art and Unicode art in
an interactive way directly from the terminal


This is in very ealy stage - the main idea
is to enable people to create text-art in by
using terminedia's capabilities, without having
to resort to Python programming.

This is also set as a demonstration project
for terminedia: https://github.com/jsbueno/terminedia

How to run: pip install the main branch directly with
`pip install git+https://github.com/jsbueno/terminedia-paint.git
and run "terminedia-paint" on the terminal.

(in this early stage, it just blanks the screen:
while there is no interactive help, draw around
with the mouse + direction keys ('x' to toggle drawing),
press 'c' to pick a color) 'q' quits the app.
